# Part 1a: Linear classifier:
Already given cdode from Logistic Regression slide: slide 15-16. Code example
Page: in4050/h24/w7_solutions : linear classifier, gradient descent

Tasks:
    - tuning: accuracy, tune for lr and epoch. make a table. 
    - scaling: scaling the features: normalization (2024_w8 code)
    - 59% acc -> 76%

# Part 1b: logistic regression
From w7_solutions use code.


(For predicting probabilities: Might get issue with size of matrix)
- Probability is just y = X*weights, dont returns a bool value.
- Calculate loss, binary cross entropy. Implement
- "One-vs-rest" with logistic regression: 


# Part 2:
Multi class neural network: Just apply softmax to output layer. (2024_w9)


# Part 3:
Make sure all plots is included.


# For multi class log - use a wrapper from week 8 notes
